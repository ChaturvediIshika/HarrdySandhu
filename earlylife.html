      <p>He played cricket for over a decade as a fast bowler, but suffered a severe elbow injury, forcing him to give up the game 
        in 2007.[8] He shifted his focus from sports to singing, took vocal training for eighteen months and performed his first 
        album "This is Harrdy Sandhu" in 2011 composed by V. Grooves.[8] He released the video of song "Tequilla Shot" from album 
        but the song and album didn't perform so well. He was disappointed and decided to leave singing if his next single track did 
        not perform well. He met lyricist Jaani and Music Director B Praak to make the song named "Soch" which was released in 2013.
         The song became huge hit and it changed the life of Sandhu and the full team associated with the song. The song was one of 
         the biggest hits of that year and it is highly loved by audience till date.

        He is married to Zenith Sandhu who also featured in the famous song Backbone.
        
        He made his debut as an actor with Punjabi movie "Yaaran Da Katchup" in 2014. The movie proved to be average. But he kept
         giving hits as a singer with tracks such as "Joker","Backbone", "Horn Blow","Yaar Ni Milya" with Jaani and B Praak, which 
         proved to be big hits.
        
        Later in 2017 he released track "Naah" featuring Nora Fatehi, with lyrics by Jaani and music by B Praak. The track proved 
        to be a big hit across the nation. In 2018 after huge success of Naah, he released "Kya Baat Ay" with the same team, which
         also proved to be a huge hit. With the songs Naah and Kya Baat Ay, Harrdy became a National level superstar. Both songs 
         crossed 500+ million views on YouTube individually.
        
        In later years, he released some other tracks such as "Superstar", "Dance Like", "Jee Karda", "Titliaan Warga", which were
         also hits. He also sang some tracks in Bollywood films such as "Chandigarh" from Good Newwz and "Naah Goriye" from Bala.
        
        He made his Bollywood debut as an actor with sports drama film '83, which is based on India's victorious campaign at the
         1983 Cricket World Cup. He played the role of former Team India fast bowler Madan Lal, who was an important part of the 
         1983 world cup winning team. [9][10] In November 2021, he released new single Bijlee Bijlee written and composed by Jaani 
         and music by B Praak released by Jaani's music label Desi Melodies. 
        The song became instant hit and its hook dance step became viral on Instagram reels with more than 1.4 million reels.</p>
